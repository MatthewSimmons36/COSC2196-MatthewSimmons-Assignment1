      <p>One of my ideal job positions at this stage in my Information Technology journey would be a Senior Cyber Security Analyst. As a Senior Cyber Security Analyst, one would use their skills and abilities to ensure the company is safeguarded from all potential vulnerabilities. This would be carried out by way of introducing up to date cyber security principles, as well as maintaining the current level of protection that the company already has in place. This will ensure the company can continue to conduct business as normal and will keep the business safe from potential attacks.</p>
      <br>
      <p>This job appeals to me for a couple of reasons. The first is the position as a senior. To achieve this job title, one will have gained a great amount of experience in a cyber security role. As written in the job listing provided, this would be a (Sime Darby) Minimum 3-4 years' experience in a cyber security role of a diversified international corporation. I would feel a great sense of pride and accomplishment to be able to conduct my role with confidence, as a Senior Cyber Security Analyst, after gaining such experience. The second reason why I’m drawn to this position is simply, the fact that I love solving problems. I like the idea of having to both (Sime Darby) work proactively as well as reactively to ensure security is maintained to the highest degree. Lastly is the potential of working remotely. My wife and I plan on starting to expand our family in the coming years and with the cost of living always going up, I can see the benefits working as much as possible. Being able to be home for my kids to see them grow as well is extremely important to me.</p>
      <br>
      <p>To successfully execute this role, one will need to have completed a formally accredited education in Information Technology or equivalent disciplines. These include but are not limited to, A bachelor’s degree in IT or Computer Science, Microsoft Azure accreditation for cloud computing and an Ethical Hacking Certificate. Certifications in Offensive Operations, Cyber Defence, Cloud Security, Industrial Control Systems, Digital Forensics and in Management, Legal and Audit certificates from an organisation such as, GICA Certifications, would also be of great benefit and possibly even essential. As mentioned in the previous paragraph a minimum of 3-4 years’ experience in a similar role is also required to be considered for this job offer.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The skills and qualifications I currently have begun with obtaining my Year 12 HSC. I then went on to receive a Cert III in Light Vehicle Automotive, where I worked for several years as a light vehicle mechanic. I gained a range of experience which included servicing and repair, wheel alignments, diagnostic testing, auto electrical work as well as engineering skills such as welding and fabrication. I then advanced my career and gained a Cert III in Engineering (Diesel Fitting). With those qualifications, I then worked as a Diesel Fitter and a Road Transport Truck Mechanic. I obtained my HR truck license, which I needed to carry out my work on trucks. As well as that I hold a forklift ticket that I use daily. I also am certified in Basic CPR and Advanced CPR as I am a first aid officer, which is an extra duty that I am responsible for in my current role as a Diesel Fitter.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The career I’m perusing seems to be a totally different world from my life as a Mechanic and Diesel Fitter. I have the passion to advance my education by gaining certificates in areas outside of my degree from RMIT. Whether that is while I’m working on my degree or after will depend on if I can find the time or not. I’m lucky enough to be working for a company that is owned by Sime Darby. I have the possibility be set up with an individual development plan, where I could gain experience in relevant IT roles within the company, as well as Sime Darby. I don’t have precise details of how this will work yet as I’ve just started studying part time, though my company is aware of my studies, and I have been told I should be able to get help wherever needed. I plan to take advantage of this opportunity when I am further into my studies.</p>
