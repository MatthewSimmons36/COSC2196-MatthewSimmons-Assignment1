      <div class="writing">
        <p>As I read and consider the results of my personality profile, it becomes obvious to me that I have quite an introverted personality even though I don’t seem to hesitate to speak up in a group. I do feel as though I have a distinct purpose in life and honestly, I feel as though this degree is exactly what I’m meant to be doing at the stage in my life. Perhaps it’s a bit more difficult for me to learn if I must rely on readying alone, however this may not be uncommon. Although I may feel I’m creative, I may still have a lot to learn from others, how to tap further into my creativity. I agree with the results of the three tests that I undertook, though with that said, it may mean that I need to really focus and push myself when it comes to group work. I find it very interesting that I am an audible learner. It’s no surprise as I love to listen to non-fiction audio books.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I think the one thing that would influence my behaviour when working in a team is to not be shy and don’t be afraid to throw ideas out there even if I think they may be viewed as correct or too basic. I will defiantly try and learn how others use their creativity so I can build on my own. Knowing that I am compassionate, understanding and I enjoy helping people will be an asset in group work and I will use this knowledge of self to the best of my abilities should anything arise.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Now that I have these results, when forming a team to work with I’ll be sure to look for group members who have strengths different to my own. This way it will ensure, the group will be evenly weighted and come together stronger. I might find someone else who is more assertive in certain situations is exactly what I need to have in my group. I think also that will help with what could also be a negative trait in my personality type which is, self-doubt and maybe even lack of confidence.</p>
