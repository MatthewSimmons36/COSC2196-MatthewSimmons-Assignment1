# COSC2196 _matthew.simmons_assessment1_myprofile

I have made this on a 1080p 27" monitor, When I checked on my phone it seems its not optimised for mobile.

This website was made with my windows start bar/ menu bar in the hidden setting for a full screen look. In the "about me" section, the text "scroll down to see my poodles" should show neatly at the bottom of the screen. It will be covered with the menu bar if it is not hidden.
